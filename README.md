RavenChat
=========
RavenChat or "Raven" is an attempt to build a server-less fully encrypted chat app.
###Contacts Setup Process
It would probably involve users adding each others to their contacts using a QR code based mechanism. This pairing ideally happens when both users are physically together.
Once the pairing is done they can communicate like any other chat app.
